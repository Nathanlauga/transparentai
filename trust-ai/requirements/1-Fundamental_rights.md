Fundamental rights
------

European commission reference : 1.1, p.15

### Description

    In situations where there is a risk of a negative impact on fundamental rights, a fundamental rights impact assessment should be undertaken. This analysis should be carried out prior to its development and should include an assessment of whether those risks can be reduced or justified as necessary in order to respect the rights and freedoms of others. In addition, mechanisms should be established to receive external feedback on AI systems that may affect fundamental rights.

    As fundamental rights are legally binding, respect for them is therefore the first characteristic of a trustworthy AI, i.e. a "lawful AI". It is therefore necessary to call upon a person familiar with the legal framework in which the AI is established in order to validate it.

### How to respect this aspect ?

*Has a person with legal knowledge of the area where AI will be used been able to ensure that fundamental human rights are respected ?*
